### create-portal-vs-render

This repository contains an example of the difference
between `ReactDOM.createPortal` vs `ReactDOM.render`. (Inspired from my [answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46435051/4248342) regarding the usage of Portals in React v16.)

It is bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, To run the example

1. Clone the repository.
2. yarn install
3. yarn start
